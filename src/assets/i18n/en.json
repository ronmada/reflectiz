          "TITLE": "3 Trainings Per Week",
          "QUESTION": "How many trainings are recommended each week?",
          "ANSWER": "We recommend at least 3 trainings a week in order for the trainings to be most efficient. <br/>Of course, you are welcome to train even more - a new workout opens every day. <br/>The reason for this amount is that, just like in physical training, it is important to challenge yourself significantly and over time, in order for your body to invest the necessary energy towards making changes and strengthening its systems."
        },
        "ITEM_2": {
          "TITLE": "Daily Training",
          "QUESTION": "How many trainings can I do in a day? Why are additional training sessions restricted?",
          "ANSWER": "The daily workout is conducted once each day.<br/>After completing your training session you may move to the exercise section and continue practicing freely with the individual exercises.<br/>Your next training session will open the next morning, allowing your brain to rest and process what it learned. This process, called \"consolidation,\" is similar to the rest that muscles need in order to recover and build after a workout."

          "TITLE": "Limiting Breaks",
          "QUESTION": "I had to stop in the middle of the training session. Can I repeat it? Why are the break times limited?",
          "ANSWER": "We encourage continuous practice without breaks to achieve maximum efficiency. This is why the breaks' durations are limited to two minutes. If you take a break, we recommend returning to your training as soon as possible, even before the break ends. </br>After two minutes of break, the training will terminate and you will be returned to the main page. <br/>If you completed the vast majority of the training session prior to the break, your current training will be locked and the next training session will open the following morning. If you have only done part of the training prior to the break, youur daily training will start again from the beginning."

          "TITLE": "Repeating the Rolling Exercise",
          "QUESTION": "Why does the \"Rolling Stones\" game pop up so often during my training session?",
          "ANSWER": "The \"Rolling Stones\" game is very important as it works on attention, which is one of the cornerstones of memory. \"Attention strengthening\" works on the ability to focus on the important things. This ability is critical to memory processes. Different levels of the \"Rolling Stones\" game focus on different attention components (including attentional control, focused attention, spatial attention, and more). Since this exercise works on several attentional components, it is played repeatedly in order to make sure that each of the different attention components is adequately trained to allow for a comprehensive and thorough workout."

        "ITEM_5": {
          "TITLE": "Training Results Graphs",
          "QUESTION": "What can I learn from my \"Trained Abilities\" graphs?",
          "ANSWER": "The \"Training Results\" page includes a list of the cognitive abilities that were trained during the session.<br/>For each cognitive ability, an aggregate score is calculated based on the following properties: the success rate (accuracy), the speed of execution (how many clicks were delivered), the difficulty of the level (amount of items, presentation durations, etc.), and finally, the cumulative training history. <br/><br/><br/>There is no maximum score for this index - the more accurately and quickly you answer, the higher the score will be. <br/>The index is calculated separately for each cognitive ability, and it combines the different exercises targeting each ability in a training. Therefore, some changes between trainings may reflect the combination of exercises you completed."

        "ITEM_6": {
          "TITLE": "Previous Training Results",
          "QUESTION": "Where can I find my previous training results?",
          "ANSWER": "All your training results are can be found on the \"My results\" page. <br/>On this page you can move between trainings you completed on different dates and view detailed reports of your training results."
        },
        "ITEM_7": {
          "TITLE": "Exercise Instructions",
          "QUESTION": "What if I've forgotten the instructions for an exercise in the middle of a training session?",
          "ANSWER": "During each exercise there are three buttons that appear in the lower right corner, including a button with a question mark. This is the help button. Clicking on it will open the help window and pause the exercise (for a limited time). <br/>In the help window that will appear, you will see a written explanation of the exercise, as well as the option to click \"Show Tutorial,\" which will take you through a version of the game in which will guide you through each step. This window can be accessed at any time, even while training in more advanced levels. </br> You can learn more about the help button in the tutorial video, \"System Buttons\""

          "TITLE": "Coin Collection",
          "QUESTION": "How many coins can I collect from using the program? What can I use them for?",
          "ANSWER": "Each workout earns 5 coins.<br>In addition, each week you meet the recommendation of at least 3 workouts gives a bonus of 25 coins!<br>Therefore, you can accumulate up to 60 coins a week.<br>Throughout the trainings, new challanges will be added to your road map, the completion of which is a milestone that earns extra coins 😊<br>Referring a friend - an addition of 100 coins.<br>And what do you do with the coins?<br>They can be used to redeem benefits distributed along your journey, such as courses, audio books and more.<br>In addition, 25 coins are equivalent to a 1% discount when renewing the subscription up to a maximum discount of 50%!"

          "ANSWER": "If an exercise has a lock symbol, it means that access to it is locked for the time being.<br/>Access to the exercises is opened gradually, since most exercises open only after you have been introduced to them during your weekly training. As you progress in your training, other exercises will gradually open."

Clicking on any ability (connectivity, working memory, etc.), you will open the cognitive glossary window which presents an in-depth description of the selected ability."

          "TITLE": "Opening Exercises",
          "QUESTION": "When do the individual exercises open (on the \"Exercises\" page)?",
          "ANSWER": "Our application is designed to encourage optimal memory and attention training. Therefore, it is important that you first complete your daily training before moving on to individual exercises, since they do not necessarily address factors like pace, duration, or variety. The continuous training does, however, take these factors into account. Therefore, the individual exercises will only be opened once the daiy training is completed."

You will reach “My Journey” page, where you can navigate to all of your collected contents.

          "ANSWER": "An assessment is a sequence of 4 exercises that appears every once in a while about every six weeks and replaces the daily workout.<br/>The exercises in the assessment are different from those in the training sessions. The level of difficulty of the exercises does not change as the assessment progresses, and there is no indication of correct or incorrect answers during the assessment.<br/>The purpose of the assessment is for us to obtain a snapshot of the overall standing of all users. This snapshot helps us to understand the various factors that influence your training and progress, which allows us to generate insights that will improve your personal training. You may skip the test by pressing the \"Skip\" button and moving right along to the daily training."

    "ADMINISTRATIVE_ATTENTION": {
      "TITLE": "Executive attention",
      "DESCRIPTION": "The executive attention system is our brain's cognitive \"manager\": when our attention is pulled in several directions, the executive attention system manages how the brain should act and where we should direct our attention. For example, when two things are happening simultaneously, the executive attention system will decide which event we should respond to first. Executive attention is what allows us to identify errors, make quick decisions in risky situations, and overcome bad habits by suppresssing automatic actions. This ability also helps us with day-to-day cognitive challenges such as regulating emotions, delaying gratification, and long-term planning."
    },
    "WORK_MEMORY": {
      "TITLE": "Working memory",
      "DESCRIPTION": "Our working memory holds all of the information we need to perform a particular task. This information can be received from our senses (sight, hearing, smell, etc.) or we can extract it from the vast store of information we have in our long-term memory. The working memory connects all of the necessary pieces of information in order to achieve the desired result. The information that is held by the working memory can then be manipulated. For example, when we have numbers in mind we are able to perform calculations on them, whether it's at a restaurant or when we're doing our taxes. Another example: when we cook according to a recipe, our working memory is what allows us to remember the steps and ingredients needed. The capacity of working memory is limited, however: the average person can hold roughly five items in their working memory at a given time."
    },
    "INFORMATION_PROCESSING": {
      "TITLE": "Information processing",
      "DESCRIPTION": "Information processing is the initial process of identifying and analyzing the information received to the brain from the senses. The brain's ability to efficiently understand, analyze, process, and send information depends on a number of factors, particularly the quality and quantity of neural connections between the brain cells. For example, when we see an image of 3 connected lines, the brain picks up that information, compares it to existing information stored in long-term memory, and comes to the conclusion that it is a triangle. This is the mechanism of information processing."
    },
    "SEMANTIC_MEMORY": {
      "TITLE": "Semantic memory",
      "DESCRIPTION": "The word \"semantics\" means \"meaning\". Semantic memory is the complete collection of general knowledge we have accumulated over the years. It is a memory of general knowledge and facts, which includes virtually everything we know about the world around us. Semantic memory contains information about the identity and characteristics of various objects - which can be concrete things like \"table\" or \"dog\", as well as abstract things like \"invention\" or \"democracy\". Semantic memory not only represents the individual objects, but also the different connections between them, such as the connection between sea and ship or sea and watermelon - the ship and watermelon are both connected to the sea, but the type of connection between them is very different. The knowledge that exists in semantic memory allows us to understand the role of objects in the world and the meaning of the information received from the senses, and to decide how to respond to it. All in all, semantic memory allows us to understand and decipher the world."

      "DESCRIPTION": ""
    },
    "SPATIAL_ATTENTION": {
      "TITLE": "Spatial attention",
      "DESCRIPTION": "Spatial attention is a type of attention that refers to the division of our awareness in space, such as our field of vision. Directing attention to a specifc area in space allows us to better absorb the information contained in it, such as being able to identify a certain object or to distinguish between an object and its background. It is important to pay attention to the entirety of our visual field, so as not to miss important things that may be happening in our environment."
    },
    "FOCUS_ATTENTION": {
      "TITLE": "Focused attention",
      "DESCRIPTION": "Focused attention is the process of focusing on a particular thing. It can be a person, an image, a sound, a thought, etc. Attention is necessary for relevant information to undergo in-depth analysis and be stored in working memory. Therefore, focused attention allows us to focus on what is really important at that moment and requires high concentration."
    },
    "SELECTIVE_ATTENTION": {
      "TITLE": "Selective attention",
      "DESCRIPTION": "Selective attention is the ability to manage one's attention through information filtering. It allows us to direct attention to specific information while ignoring all other things happening at that moment. For example, selective attention allows us to concentrate on reading a newspaper when people are talking around us. The more the information that is important to us is similar to the information that should be ignored, the more \"strained\" our selective attention is. For example, it may be more difficult to listen to someone talking when there are other conversations in the background, compared to a situation where music is playing in the background. When we exercise selective attention, we are actually managing the information obtained. Without it, our attention will be drawn to the most prominent items around us, which are not necessarily the most important, and may impair our ability to remember the important things."
    },
    "INHIBITION": {
      "TITLE": "Inhibition",
      "DESCRIPTION": "nhibition, which is part of attentional control, is the ability to stop a response from execution. For example, try completing the following sentence with an inappropriate word: \"The light at a traffic light changes from red to yellow, and then it changes to _______.\" If the word \"green\" immediately occurred to you and you had to activate a mental 'brake' to replace it with, say, the word \"purple\" - congratulations, you experienced inhibition. This capability allows impulse control and blocking of automatic responses. Problems with this skill may manifest as impulsivity or difficulty stopping and thinking before performing an action."
    },
    "CHUNKING": {
      "TITLE": "Chunking",
      "DESCRIPTION": "Chunking is the process of connecting several items together and constructing them into one group. The resulting group - called a chunk - is a new, individual object, a single block of meaning. An interesting example of chunking occurs with chess players. While the average person looking at a chessboard will simply see various tools placed across the board, an expert chess player - who knows how to identify the relations between the placed tools - will see on the board strategic clusters of defense and attack. The chunking process helps a lot in memory processes, in part because one cluster (like the word FBI) ​​is stored more efficiently than multiple individual items (the individual letters F, B, and I), and even takes up less space in working memory."
    },
    "ATTENTION": {
      "TITLE": "Attention",
      "DESCRIPTION": "Attention is the ability to actively process specific information while tuning out other details in the environment. It is often simulated as an inner spotlight that we turn to our senses in order to receive new information. Attention is partially involved in most of our thinking processes: we need attention to take in new information, we need to maintain stable attention to stay focused, and we can even decide which information we want to process and which information we want to ignore. For example, if you are talking to a friend and at the same time you are waiting for the train to arrive,  you can be staring directly to your friend but  you still will be able to know when the train arives. this activation of the inner spotlight  is called  attention orientation. Attention playes a crucial role in proccecing the information that comes to our minds. Without it, it is almost imposible to create new memories. Attention is a limited resource, forcing us to be selective about what we decide to focus on."

    "ASSOCIATIVE_CONNECTIONS": {
      "TITLE": "Creating associations",
      "DESCRIPTION": "When two information items are linked in our minds, like \"Cat\" and \"Dog\", \"Coffe\" and \"Cake\", an association is formed. these mental links are created automatically. This ability is necesery for memory procesess and Information in long term memory is stored by associations. Training the ability to create associative connections is one of the ways to improve memory retrival. Associative links can be created intentially by linking two concepts together. Due to the fact that our brain uses associations every day, artificially creating them can help improve our memory."
    },
    "ASSOCIATIVE_CHAIN": {
      "TITLE": "Associations chain",
      "DESCRIPTION": "creating association chains is a memory strategy, also called \"road story\", that can help remember lists. in order to creat a chan association, we need to creat an associative link between the first and second item on the list, and then between the second and third items on the list and so on. The story we ultimatly get by combining all the items on the list, is much easier to remember."

    "CATEGORIZATION": {
      "TITLE": "Categorization",
      "DESCRIPTION": "Categorization is the ability to cast different items into groups based on a common ground between certain items. Some example groupings may be furniture, animals, things that start with the letter A. Diving information intocategories helps to organize it efficiently, making it easier to save in memory and retrieve in the future."
    },
    "CONNECTIVITY": {
      "TITLE": "Binding",
      "DESCRIPTION": "Binding is the \"gluing\" together of different pieces of information. One type of binding is between different dimensions of the same object. For example, when we see a basketball, one part of the brain is responsible for perceiving the orange color, another for perceiving the round shape, a third part for capturing the smell of the rubber, and another part for linking these features together to create a full object that we call a basketball. In other words, binding is responsible for connecting different features into a single object with a specific meaning. Thus, an orange basketball is different from a blue basketball, and an orange basketball is different from an orange (despite them being the same shape and color). Another type of binding is between different things or objects that relate to each other, such as a hat and a water bottle, a cup and a coaster, or a purse and the items kept inside of it. Binding is not only important for fully understanding and remembering things, but also for remembering when and where we encountered them."

    "COGNITIVE_FLEXIBILITY": {
      "TITLE": "Cognitive flexibility",
      "DESCRIPTION": "Cognitive flexibility is a mental process of shifting focused attention from one concept to another. We can do it consciously, for example when trying to think like another person, or unconsciously. Cognitive flexibility refers to our ability to alter our perspective and behavior in response to changes in our environment in order to achieve a desired outcome. Having difficulties with this ability can restrict our range of responses."
